### Introduction

Observe the *'laws that govern the building of wealth'* and you will gain wealth. Be sure to spend wealth wisely as wellâ€”excessive hoarding will leave you unsatisfied and miserable, at worst robbed. Unrestrained spending will exhaust your wealth, and if you do not have the self-control, drive you into debt.

### Seven Cures for a Lean Purse

1. **Start thy purse to fattening.** For every ten coins you earn, take only nine out of your purse. Leave 10% of your income untouched. This may not be an easy task for those that spend all that they earn, thus: 
2. **Control thy expenditures**. Expenditures will always grow to equal income unless checked. Most people spend more than they *need.* Create a budget of your expenditures for a month; check off those that you think are *necessary*, and cut those that you think are not. Make sure to adhere to this budget, and not touch the income that is fattening your purse.
3. **Make thy gold multiply.** There is no point in storing money forever, like a miser. You must make the money work for you and earn; invest it. Your real wealth is not in your purse; that wealth is finite, and runs out. It is in your income, that is constant.
4. **Guard thy treasures from loss.** If it's too good to be true, then it is. Invest only where your principal is secure. 
5. **Make of thy dwelling a profitable investment.** Own your house; it will provide you comfort and freedom. If you already rent a home, take a loan and buy one. You will merely substitute the landlord for the moneylender, and the moneylender is impermanent; your loan will not take more than a few years to pay off, principal and interest. 
5. **Insure a future income**. Secure a sizable saving so that you do not have to work at an old age.
5. **Increase thy ability to earn.** Skill yourself. Thus, you will earn more, save more, invest more, and spend more. Work hard too, which is another prerequisite for earning more.
