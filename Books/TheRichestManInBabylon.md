### Introduction

Observe the *'laws that govern the building of wealth'* and you will gain wealth. Be sure to spend wealth wisely as well-- excessive hoarding will leave you unsatisfied and miserable, at worst robbed. Unrestrained spending will exhaust your wealth, and if you do not have the self-control, drive you into debt.

### The Laws that Govern the Building of Wealth

1. **A part of all you earn is yours to keep**. If you save one-tenth of your earnings for 10 years, you will have savings worth 1 year of your income.

2. **Make your money work for you.** Those savings are not to be spent lavishly at a later date, not even to be saved for some emergency, but to earn *more money*. If you invest them such that they are 2x their worth by the time those 10 years pass, you will have 2 years worth of income.  

3. **Consult the experts.** Do not get scammed. Consult those you know, who know. Only then invest. Do not take the advice of a brick-maker on jewels, nor the advice of a farmer on stars; leave that to the astrologer.
