### Introduction

Observe the *'laws that govern the building of wealth'* and you will gain wealth. Be sure to spend wealth wisely as wellâ€”excessive hoarding will leave you unsatisfied and miserable, at worst robbed. Unrestrained spending will exhaust your wealth, and if you do not have the self-control, drive you into debt.

### Seven Cures for a Lean Purse

1. **Start thy purse to fattening.** For every ten coins you earn, take only nine out of your purse. Leave 10% of your income untouched. This may not be an easy task for those that spend all that they earn, thus: 
2. **Control thy expenditures**. Expenditures will always grow to equal income unless checked. Most people spend more than they *need.* Create a budget of your expenditures for a month; check off those that you think are *necessary*, and cut those that you think are not. Make sure to adhere to this budget, and not touch the income that is fattening your purse.
3. **Make thy gold multiply.** There is no point in storing money forever, like a miser. You must make the money work for you and earn; invest it. Your real wealth is not in your purse; that wealth is finite, and runs out. It is in your income, that is constant.
4. **Guard thy treasures from loss.** If it's too good to be true, then it is. Invest only where your principal is secure. 
5. **Make of thy dwelling a profitable investment.** Own your house; it will provide you comfort and freedom. If you already rent a home, take a loan and buy one. You will merely substitute the landlord for the moneylender, and the moneylender is impermanent; your loan will not take more than a few years to pay off, principal and interest. 
5. **Insure a future income**. Secure a sizable saving so that you do not have to work at an old age.
5. **Increase thy ability to earn.** Skill yourself. Thus, you will earn more, save more, invest more, and spend more. Work hard too, which is another prerequisite for earning more.

### The Five Laws of Gold

1. **Gold cometh gladly and in increasing quantity to any man who will put by not less than one-tenth of his earnings to create an estate for his future and that of his family.** 
   - Like the 1st cure, this law recommends you to save 1/10th of your income 'to create an estate'.
2. **Gold laboreth diligently and contentedly for the wise owner who finds for it profitable employment, multiplying even as the flocks of the field.**
   - If you utilize your gold wisely, you can multiply it through investments and other means.
3. **Gold clingeth to the protection of the cautious owner who invests it under the advice of men wise in its handling.**
   - When expending your money for profitable purposes, take the advice of men trustworthy and wise in these businesses.
4. **Gold slippeth away from the man who invests it in businesses or purposes with which he is not familiar or which are not approved by those skilled in its keep.** 
   - Otherwise, you will lose it all. 
5. **Gold flees the man who would force it to impossible earnings or who followeth the alluring advice of tricksters and schemers or who trusts it to his own inexperience and romantic desires in investment.**
   - Also take care not to be scammed. If it's too good to be true, then it is.

### Extra Advice

- *Better a little caution than a great regret.*
- *Do not afford to be without adequate protection of all forms, physical, mental, and others.*
- *Where the determination is, the way can be found.*
