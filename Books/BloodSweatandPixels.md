### Introduction

Games are tough to make. Time crunches, technological limitations, and play testing all make it grueling work. Making a video game is more grueling than making a movie, yet often with a fraction of the budget. This is because:

1. **They're interactive** — Video games are distinguished by this feature. Even in a choose-your-own-adventure book you get, at most, a couple potential paths and a couple choices at various points that lead into these paths. But in a video game, the choices are endless. And, even harder is the fact that players prefer to make these choices *when* they want. Not only do your games have to have a million choices, these choices also need to be available whenever; games are not linear.
2. **Technological change** — Movie directors and animators (among others) also deal with constant change in technology. Every year, some new revolution is pushed. But they have far larger budgets, and they only have to deal with far less changes. Game developers, because their games are interactive, have to deal with a lot more changes.
3. **Scheduling is impossible** — Video games are a piece of art. It is hard to schedule art. Then there's the tech aspect…
4. **It's impossible to measure fun** — Everyone has different standards for fun. It's hard to figure out who's right and who isn't when play-testing for fun and enjoyment.
