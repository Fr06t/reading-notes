### [Inversion](https://untools.co/inversion)

#### The Basics

What is the best solution to a problem? If you do not know the answer directly, look at it more abstractly: the best solution is the opposite of the worst solution. It follows, therefore, that if you know the worst solution to a problem, you can pick it apart to find the best solution to the problem

#### Steps

1. Find the **worst** solution to a problem.
2. Find out *why* it's the worst solution to said problem.
3. Either reverse these reasons to find the best solution, or work around them to find an agreeable solution to the problem.

### [Issue Trees](https://untools.co/issue-trees)

#### The Basics

Issue trees are maps of problems; you map out all the major and minor reasons for a problem. You can then solve minor problems individually to get rid of the major problems. Also helps you understand your problems. 

Some issue trees are also created as 'solution trees', where the goal is to figure out **how** to *solve* an issue; as opposed to 'problem trees', where the goal is to find out **why** *something* is an issue.

#### Steps

##### Problem Tree

1. Break down the problem as best as you can.
2. Make sure that each 'break-down' does not overlap with another, and they
3. Do not use your own hypotheses; use consumer surveys, for example.

##### Solution Tree

1. Break down the problem as best as you can.
2. Take out each part and ask 'How?' (can we solve this?)
3. Brainstorm a solution to each level of break-down

### [First Principles](https://untools.co/first-principles)

#### The Basics

First principles are a basic solution to a complex problem. Break down the problem into its simplest parts and figure your way back up by compiling a solution. Grassroots problem-solving, basically. This is the more abstract version of 'issue trees'.

#### Steps

Breaking a problem down requires a skillset of its own, and is not so simple as it sounds. There are a number of methods to help with this:

##### The Five Whys

First, find the problem. After that, ask 'why?' (why is this happening?). Once you've answered that, ask it againâ€”five times. This method is for more simple-moderate level problems since it pursues a single-track of problems and causes.

##### Socratic Questioning

Utilize Socratic questioning to find out and elaborate on your problem:

1. Clarification - "What do you mean?"
2. Probing assumptions - "What else can we consider?"
3. Probing reasons - "Why do you think this is true?"
4. Implications and Consequences - "What effects would this have?"
5. Different viewpoints - "What else could we do?"
6. Questioning the question - "What was the point of asking this?"
